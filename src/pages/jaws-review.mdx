# Jaws: The Classic Summertime Movie

Beachside camping? Well, there’s an obvious choice. Hailing from 1975 and directed by Steven Spielberg, Jaws was

a masterpiece of movie making and has excellent acting by Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and 
Lorraine Gary among others. 
We dare you to go for a nighttime swim after watching this one. Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum da-dum…
