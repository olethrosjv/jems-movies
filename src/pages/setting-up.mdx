# Setting up your own DIY backyard movie theater

An outdoor movie night isn't just for a public park or drive-in theater. With the right equipment and setup, you can create a DIY backyard movie
theater of your own. 

For a real movie night outdoors, you need a portable projector. Fortunately, there are many outdoor projectors available these days at a 
variety of prices. Pay attention to the lumens (how bright the projector is) and the resolution at the desired range. You will also want to make 
sure that your projector can handle your content format (Blu-ray, external hard drive, HDMI connection, etc.). Don't rush this purchase. 
Do the research.  

You need to think about where you are going to project your movie? An old DIY standard is a sheet tacked up on a fence or wall. But that isn't 
dependable, and the slightest breeze will wreak havoc with the picture. Instead, the ambitious can build a PVC pipe frame for a more 
professional-looking screen. Or you can get an outdoor screen that comes with a firm stand. Depending on where you live and the time of year, 
the wind can be a huge factor.  

Looking for a more go-big-or-go-home screen for a larger group? Many people rent an inflatable screen. You can also skip the screen and
projector altogether by buying an outdoor television

## Getting Started with Audio for your backyard projector. 

You may have a picture, but now you need sound to go with your DIY outdoor movie screen. A basic soundbar is relatively easy to move out and 
hook up to a projector if it is compatible and if you have one on hand. If you have an outdoor Bluetooth speaker, you may be able to connect 
it to your projector as well, depending on capabilities. Or consider buying a durable, affordable speaker set (a three-piece set is usually 
sufficient) that you can bring outside. This is also a good time to explore any local or HOA regulations on noise levels and backyard sound, 
just in case your DIY backyard movie theater needs a few tweaks.
